We are interested in developing four games and one simulation.



For our games, we intend to have a title screen to pick which game the user wants to play. The games we want to make are Frogger, a racing game, an infinite runner, and Chess. Frogger will be more or less the same as it is for the singleplayer arcade game, with the arrow keys being used for movement. For the racing game, we would like to have it be a two-player game, with a top-down view of the track. The players will steer their cars using the A and D keys for player 1 and the left and right arrow keys for player two to steer left and right respectively. For our infinite runner, we would like to make it so you control a ball that’s constantly getting lifted towards the ceiling and needs to navigate through holes in a bunch of constantly rising walls to avoid being crushed.This game will have a single mousePressed action that negates your acceleration make it more difficult to navigate through the holes. Every wall you pass through will get you a point. Your score will be how many you go through before you get crushed. For Chess, we’d like to have it so two players face off against each other. The pieces would be moved using the mouse to drag them to a legal spot they can go to. There would also be a 10-minute chess timer.



For our simulation, we would like to make a Verlet rope, which consists of a bunch of objects linked together to create realistic rope physics. We’d like to attach the head of the rope to the mouse to move it around, and would also like to have a peg in the middle of the window that the rope can’t go through to demonstrate how the rope physics work.



We believe that for the grading, 80 points should go to the organization and use of the class hierarchy, 20 points for succesfully putting the games together under a title screen, 35 points for each of the four games working correctly, 40 points for the simulation working correctly, and 20 point for javadoc comments



For our schedule, for the games we would like to have all of the hierarchies complete by the 25th, and have each game done by the 2nd of May. As for the verlet rope, we'd like to have it done by the 25th. The most important milestone is the hierarchies, since that's what every game is based off of.
